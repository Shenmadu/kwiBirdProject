        <span id="highlight-id">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown,
            fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the
        kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the
        size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
        found only in New Zealand.

            The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tendto be very steep and wet,
            surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
            into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the
            ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows within its
            territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown
            at the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her eggs.

        <p id="paragraph3-id">
            Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other
            and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do
            fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she
            is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi
            invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis
            have been known to fight to the death, although this is
            rare.<br> <br>
            An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
            female may choose a new male if a more desirable one
            wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or
            fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one
            around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested,
            the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
            Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests
            might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
            by the male.<br> <br>
            The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs
            are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color.
            They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg
            might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would
            be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving
            birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to
            the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the
            female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
            rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
            kilograms).
